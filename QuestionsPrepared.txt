 Questions related to land on which project is being built

 1) Have you personally veerfied the title deed of the land on which the project is being constructed?

 2)Confirm that the title is ONLY in the name of developer and he has full rights to develop the land?
 3)Did you actually see the ORIGINAL DEED DOCUMENT
 (Duplicates copies of the document will not be sufficient, and may probably be that developer may have taken a loan on it)

 5)Did you personally verify the encumbrance certificate of the past 15 years for the plot on which project is being built?
 (encumbrance certificate of the land tells whether the land has any legal dues, for example if any loan is pending against the property. the certificate should be had for last 13 years)

 Calculating Areas of your Apartment?

 1) Are you very clear of the carpet area of your apartment and is it mentioned in the allotment letter abd sale deed
 2) Are you clear of the Super-Built Up Area (or) saleable area which is being offered?
 (It is recommended that you download the pdf by clicking the download link button and go through it thoroughly and answer those questions to get a clear picture)
 3)Have you downloaded the pdf and asnwered all the questons?
 4)Are you clear the actual area which you will get(i.e tha carpet area)
 5)Have you clarified from the builder all the details?
 (Again measure the exact size(carpet area) of the flat. Most of the customer take the word of builder as sacrosanct when it comes to stated size of flat, but on calculation one can many times find a 2-5% shortfall. Remember that can mean a difference of 80k to 2 lac rupee difference in a 40 lac flat. Now you get it! right ?)
 6)Are you clear about the super-area, carpet area and aothers as such clearly mentioned in the document
 7)Does the allotment letter clearly mention the maximum deviation permissible from the agreed layout plan such a ssuper-area?
 (Generally there are last minute changes to the floor plan during construction but there can be a maximum of 10% and this percentage should be clearly mentioned, and in case it is more than 10% there should be an option for buyer to backout and get complete refund of the amount paid so far)

 8)Ensure that floor plan layout, specification details , clarity between the different types of areas are a part of the 
 Allotment Letter(If possible also get the site layout plan signed as a part of the legal document)
 =================================================================================================================================

 Sale Agreement :

   --Stamp Duty and Registration Charges
 5)does the builder clearly specify that he would pay for all the outgoings such as ground rent, taxes, assessments, impositions, outgoings up to the date of delivery of flats to their respective owners?
 6)It should have the municipal-approved plan of the flat, carpet area with the area of the balconies shown separately, price of the property including the proportionate price of common areas and facilities shown separately and intervals at which installments may be paid. It should be verified that the proper stamp duty has been paid.


 ========================================================================================================================

 Others, to take extra precautions:

 1)The developer cannot make changes , or undertake additional construction which is not part of the original layout plan as in the purchase agreement. Such changes can only be made with prior written approval of all the allotees.
 (It would be better if this is explicitly specified in the sale agreement.)    
 2)The terms and conditions in the Allotment Letter explicitly mentions about refund of the booking amount in case of cancellation of the booking.
 3)The developer should explicitly mention the delay charges(penalties) to be paid by him, in case of delay in delivery of the apartments.

 Finances

 1)Is the name of the company/builder/developer on the sale deed, Allotment Letter, and other contract documents is the same as, that on the cheques you give out for all the payments. If not get a clear documentation which establishes the relationship between the two entities?
 (Ideally the name of the company name mentioned should be the same on all documents, or you could end in problems later)

 2)Does the Allotment Letter clearly say how much of the earnest money paid by you, will be refunded and any type of interest payments on the earnest money, paid to you, in case the project is cancelled or developer backs out due to financial difficulty?
 (Atleast the developer should clearly state that the earnest amount will be returned in total as lumpsum) 

 3)Does the Allotment Letter and Sale deed and other contract document clearly mention that cost of the apartment is escalation-free?
 (This means that the developer cannot demand extra money later, giving reason that cost of raw materials has increased and so on..)

 4)Does the Allotment Letter clearly mention transfer charges which have to be paid by you to developer in case oyu transfer the property to some one else's name
 (In the time period between booking the apartment by paying advance/earnest amount and when the flat is finally is registered on your at sub-registrar's office, you can transfer the flat to someone else's name but in that case, most builders demand a transfer fee to be paid to them, so the document should clearly mention how much is the amount  )

 5)Does the Allotment Letter clearly mention compensation to be paid to you by the builder in case there is a delay in construction, handover of apartment by the developer?(Most developers dont mention this, but they do mention the penality you have to pay in case you make a delay in your payment schedule of instalments)

 6)Does the Allotment Letter clearly mention the penalty amount/interest rate to be paid by you, in case there is a delay in payment of installments by you?(In some cases the interest can as high as 18%, and also are you whether the interest rate charged will be on the outstanding amount or full installment?)
 
 7)
